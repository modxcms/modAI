# Usage

Wherever you see a field or a label with a “sparkle button” (✦) next to it, click it to use the chatGPT api to create content in those fields based on the system settings prompts/configurations. By default, it automatically creates sparkle buttons for several fields as outlined below. Delete the prompt settings to remove modAI’s sparkle buttons and the generative AI content creation for those fields:

- **longtitle** – often used for the SEO Meta Title manually or with SEO Suite (should be ~70 characters)
- **description** – often used for the SEO Meta Description manually or with SEO Suite (should be ~155 characters)
- **introtext** – aka Summary, this is set to summarize the page content—useful for news/blog landing pages or as a base to generate images or image+ images from (make sure to save first so it has content to pull from)
- **content** – a freeform prompt box allows you to give instructions on the type of content to generate

If you’re not happy with what modAI generates, click the sparkle button or generate buttons again to generate another variation. You can then use the prev/next navigation buttons to go between the options. When you save, it keeps the option shown and discards the rest.
